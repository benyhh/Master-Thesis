The thesis is structured into three parts, with the first chapter serving as an introduction to the problem of pointing with radio telescopes.
In this chapter, we discuss the research questions, related works, and astronomy background.

Part I, Background \& Theory, consists of two chapters.
Chapter $2$ provides a detailed description of the pointing model developed at APEX, as well as the data used for the research.
Chapter $3$ presents the machine learning concepts that we utilized for the research.

Part II, Data Processing \& Methods, also contains two chapters.
Chapter $4$ outlines the data processing and feature engineering techniques we used in the study.
Chapter $5$ describes two machine learning experiments that we aimed at answering the research questions posed in the introduction.

Finally, Part III, Results \& Discussion, includes chapter $6$ with the results and discussion of the two experiments, following by the conclusion in chapter $7$.
In addition to the main body of the thesis, an appendix is provided, which includes other results from the resource.
