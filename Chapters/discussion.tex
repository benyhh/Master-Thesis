\section{Experiment 2: Pointing Correction Model}
There are many interesting things to discuss about the pointing correction model.
First of all, we considered two different cases of training and testing the models, case $1$ and $2$.
In case $1$, we usedsmaller amounts of data for training and testing each model, and in case $2$, we used more data for trainig and testing.
The models using smaller amounts of data for training a model, and then testing the performance on some scans coming after the training period, 
did not offer any improvement what so ever. This shows that the models perhaps require more data in order to learn meaningful relationships in the data.
The models did, however, show great results on the validation set, with validation rms compared in the range $0.6$-$0.8$ \textcolor{red}{Include table in appendix}.
This shows that the models are able to learn something from the data, but that the data is not enough to generalize to new data.
It is also possible that the
