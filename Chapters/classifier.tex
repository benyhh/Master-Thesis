A XGBoost model that classifies scans to be good or bad.

The inputs into the model is the amplitude, FWHM and offsets, along with their uncertainty.
The output from the model is a number between 0 and 1, indicating how certain the model is that the scan is good.
A score of 1 means the model is 100%certain that the scan is good. 

The model is trained on a self-made training set, where I manually labeled about 360 scans to be good bad.
I was pretty strict when classifying the scans myself, because I only wanted the cleanest scans. 
The model scan easily be trained again on a new training set.
