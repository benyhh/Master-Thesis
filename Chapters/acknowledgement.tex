I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisors, Signe Riemer-SÃ¸rensen, Rodrigo Parra, and Claudia Cicone,
for their invaluable guidance and support throughout the course of this thesis.
Signe provided expert advice and direction during our weekly meetings, and I learned a great deal from her vast knowledge and experience.
Rodrigo's extensive understanding of the APEX telescope's operation was essential to the success of this project,
and his patience and repeated explanations are greatly appreciated. Claudia provided valuable feedback,
which helped shape this thesis and led to some interesting new directions of research, and for that, I am grateful.

I extend the appreciation to my friends and family for their support and encouragement during my studies.
I would also like to thank my ping pong partners at CCSE and my chess partner at SINTEF,
who provided much-needed breaks (perhaps too many) from the research.
Most importantly, I would like to thank Kelly for her constant love and support,
which kept me motivated during the long and challenging process of writing this thesis.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge Signe's comment at our first meeting, where she said that this thesis would be my life for a year.
She was right.
