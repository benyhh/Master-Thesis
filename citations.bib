	abstract = {With a 100 m x 110 m oﬀ-axis paraboloid dish, the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) is the largest fully steerable radio telescope on Earth. A major challenge facing large ground-based radio telescopes is achieving suﬃcient pointing accuracy for observing at high frequencies, up to 116 GHz in the case of the GBT. Accurate pointing requires the ability to blindly acquire source locations and perform ad hoc corrections determined by observing nearby calibrator sources in order to obtain a starting position accurate to within a small margin of error of the target’s location. The required pointing accuracy is dependent upon the half-power beamwidth, and for the higher-frequency end of GBT observing, this means that pointing must be accurate to within a few arcseconds RMS. The GBT’s oﬀ-axis design is advantageous in that it eliminates blockage of the dish and reduces sidelobe interference, and there is no evidence that the resulting asymmetric structure adversely aﬀects pointing accuracy. However, factors such as gravitational ﬂexure, thermal deformation, azimuth track tilt and irregularity, and small misalignments and oﬀset errors within the telescope’s structure cause pointing inaccuracies. A pointing model was developed for the GBT to correct for these eﬀects. The model utilizes standard geometrical corrections along with metrology data from the GBT’s structural temperature sensors and data from measurements of the track levels. In this paper we provide a summary of the GBT’s pointing model and associated corrections, as well as a discussion of relevant metrology systems and an analysis of its current nighttime pointing accuracy.},
